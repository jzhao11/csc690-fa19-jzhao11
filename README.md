Topic:  
BuySellApp  
  
Introduction:  
This is an iOS application for students to buy and sell items on it.  
For security reason, payment will not be implemented in this app. Instead, buyers will contact sellers on this app to make purchases in person.  
  
Proposal:  
Ever wanted a more convenient marketplace at your university? BuySellApp, an iOS application, allows for on-campus buying and selling of items at anyoneâ€™s convenience. Typically, college students struggle financially on their day to day lives. However, this app will give them opportunities to sell whatever they want for some extra cash. The BuySellApp will allow students to effortlessly post new or used items as seller or purchase products as buyer, with the majority of customers being either nearby residents or students dorming at San Francisco State. BuySellApp serves as a demo marketplace for students at SFSU, after which it can also be utilized by different universities across the world and thus, offering all students the change to buy and sell.  
  
The BuySell iOS application will primarily focus on students and nearby residents of San Francisco State University in which they can buy and sell products online easily. This application is important because not only is it convenient, but it also creates opportunities for college students who are extremely tight on budgeting and just need a little extra cash, or it helps local students purchase items without the need to wait for shipping and processing. Rather, students will be able to buy products and have the option of picking it up from the seller, or having it shipped to them at their own convenience.  
  
With the knowledge of swift that I have learned from CSC690 class, I aim to create a user-friendly iOS app by providing the customers with a simplistic yet efficient user interface, in which they will be able to utilize buying and selling functionalities.
